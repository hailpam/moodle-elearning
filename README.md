# Starter Kit for Self-Hosted e-Learning Platforms Powered by Moodle

This repository provides a **starter kit** for setting up and hosting your very own e-learning platform using **Moodle**, one of the most popular open-source Learning Management Systems (LMS). With this solution, you can quickly deploy a customizable, scalable, and engaging online learning environment to cater to a wide range of educational needs.

## Features

- **Easy Setup with Docker**: The platform is powered by **Docker**, ensuring smooth and reliable deployment across any system that supports Docker. No need to worry about complicated server configurations.
- **Bitnami Moodle Distribution**: This starter kit uses the **Bitnami distribution of Moodle**, a well-tested, pre-configured package that simplifies the installation process and provides a stable, secure version of Moodle.
- **Customizable**: Build a tailored online learning experience by modifying Moodle to suit your specific requirements, whether you're creating a corporate training portal, a university course, or a community-driven learning platform.
- **Scalable**: Designed to scale as your learner base grows, ensuring high availability and performance. You can easily modify the container setup to scale horizontally, distributing the load across multiple instances.
- **Engaging**: With Moodle’s rich set of features, including quizzes, assignments, multimedia integration, and discussion forums, you can create an interactive and engaging learning experience for your users.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository, set up Docker on your system, and follow the instructions in the **Installation** section. You’ll have your Moodle-powered e-learning platform running in no time!

### Prerequisites

- Docker (ensure you have Docker installed and running on your local machine or server)
- Docker Compose (for managing multi-container setups)
- **Ansible** (for automating the deployment and configuration of the platform)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/moodle-starter-kit.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   
   ```bash
    cd moodle-starter-kit
    ```

3. Launch the Moodle platform using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4. Access your Moodle instance via ```http://localhost:8080``` (or the appropriate IP address if deploying on a server).

## Using Ansible Playbooks

In addition to Docker, this repository includes Ansible playbooks to automate the deployment and configuration of the Moodle platform. These playbooks are useful for provisioning and managing Moodle installations in different environments.

### Prerequisites for Ansible
Before running the playbooks, make sure you have Ansible installed on your local machine or deployment server. If not, you can install it by following the instructions on the Ansible installation page.

### Running the Playbooks
Ensure you have a compatible server (local or remote) where the playbooks will be run.
Modify the ```inventory.ini``` file to reflect the target servers or environments.
To deploy the Moodle platform using Ansible, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deploy-moodle.yml
```

The playbook will configure the server, install Docker, pull the Bitnami Moodle image, and set up the Moodle instance.

### Customizing the Playbooks
You can modify the provided playbooks to suit your specific needs, such as setting up environment variables, adjusting Moodle configuration options, or scaling the deployment. The playbooks are designed to be flexible and easy to extend.

## Customization

After the initial setup, you can customize the platform by editing the configuration files or using Moodle’s built-in tools to add courses, configure themes, and manage users. The Bitnami distribution includes all the essential plugins, making it easier for you to extend the platform.

## Scalability

Moodle’s architecture is designed to handle both small and large-scale deployments. By leveraging Docker and Ansible, you can easily scale the platform to handle higher traffic and larger user bases. The Ansible playbooks can be used to automate the provisioning of additional nodes or instances to distribute the load.
